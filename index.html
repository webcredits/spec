      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      The vast majority of money in the world exists in the form of Credit.
      Yet there is no way to easily model a credit between counterparites on
      the web using the Linked Data Cloud.  This specification proposes a
      vocabulary and examples that model credits between two agents, which can
      also be used to send credits to each other, building up a ledger of
      balances.  In this sense, a modular kernel of an economy can be created while
      delegating other functions such as, authentication, signing and identity
      to other specifications.

      <h2>Ontology</h2>

      The ontology / vocabulary is at https://w3id.org/cc.  The prefix cc will be
      used in examples.

      <h2>Ledgers</h2>

      A ledger is a two column list that contains a URI and a balance, or amount.
      Each Ledger will generally be linked to a wallet that contains the default
      currency.

      <pre class="turtle">
      URI cc : amount 1.23 .
      </pre>
      <p>The <dfn>Amount</dfn> indicates the balance of the agent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Credits</h2>

      <pre class="turtle">
      <#this> a cc : Credit;
        cc : source URI ;
        cc : destination URI ;
        cc : amount URI .
      </pre>
      <p>The <dfn>Source</dfn> indicates the source of the credit.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>Destination</dfn> indicates the destination of the credit.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>Amount</dfn> indicates the amount of the credit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wallets</h2>
      A wallet is a container of a ledger, it is the authority by which the
      ledger is defined.  It also will show how to find balances, and change the
      state of the ledger.

      <pre class="turtle">
      <#this> a Wallet ;
      cc : api URI .

      </pre>
      <p>The <dfn>API</dfn> shows where to get balances and add new credits.</p>
