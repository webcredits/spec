        Webcredits is an extremely simple way to model decentralized payments, balances and wallets on
        the world wide web, using Linked Data.  This specification deals with credits between counterparites, a ledger that stores balances, and a wallet to allow discovery.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      Most of the money in the world exists in the form of Credit.
      Yet there is no way to easily model a credit between counterparites on
      the web using Linked Data.  This specification proposes a
      vocabulary and examples that model credits between two agents, which can
      also be used to send payments, building up a ledger of
      balances.  In this sense, a modular kernel of an economy can be created while
      delegating other functions such as, authentication, signing, discovery and identity
      to other specifications.

        Webcredits is one of several related specifications being discussed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/">w3c web payments

        <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

        The ontology / vocabulary is at <a href="https://cc.rww.io/vocab">https://w3id.org/cc</a>.  The prefix cc will be
        used in examples, which use the Turtle serialization.

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        Webcredits will show how to model ledgers, credits and wallets, the building blocks of financial systems.

    <section>
      <h2>Credits</h2>

      Credits are the main class in webcredits.  They represent a payment from one counterparty to another.  This creates a change in the ledger.

      <section>
        <h3>Example</h3>

        <pre class="turtle">
        <#this> a cc : Credit;
          cc : source URI ;
          cc : destination URI ;
          cc : amount URI .
        </pre>
        <p>The <dfn>Source</dfn> indicates the source of the credit.</p>
        <p>The <dfn>Destination</dfn> indicates the destination of the credit.</p>
        <p>The <dfn>Amount</dfn> indicates the amount of the credit.</p>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ledgers</h2>

      A ledger is a two column list that contains a URI and a balance, or amount.
      Each Ledger will generally be linked to a wallet that contains the default
      currency.

      <section>
        <h3>Example</h3>

        <pre class="turtle">
        URI cc : amount 1.23 .
        </pre>
        <p>The <dfn>Amount</dfn> indicates the balance of the agent.</p>

      </section>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Wallets</h2>
      A wallet is a container of a ledger, it is the authority by which the
      ledger is defined.  It also will show how to find balances, and change the
      state of the ledger.

      <section>
        <h3>Example</h3>


        <pre class="turtle">
        <#this> a Wallet ;
        cc : inbox URI ;
        cc : api URI .
      </section>

      </pre>
      <p>The <dfn>API</dfn> shows where to get balances and add new credits.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>Inbox</dfn> shows where to send new web credits.</p>
